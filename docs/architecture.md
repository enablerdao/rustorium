# Rustorium Architecture

## Overview

Rustorium is built on three core technologies that work together to provide a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain platform:

1. DAG-based Transaction Processing
2. Avalanche Consensus
3. Dynamic Sharding

This document explains how these components interact and how they enable Rustorium's unique features.

## Core Technologies

### 1. DAG-based Transaction Processing

The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure allows for parallel transaction processing by tracking dependencies between transactions.

#### Key Features
- Parallel transaction validation
- Natural conflict resolution
- High throughput
- Low latency

#### Implementation
```rust
pub struct Transaction {
    id: TxId,
    dependencies: Vec<TxId>,
    data: TxData,
    signature: Signature,
}

pub struct DAGManager {
    transactions: HashMap<TxId, Transaction>,
    pending: Vec<Transaction>,
    confirmed: HashSet<TxId>,
}
```

### 2. Avalanche Consensus

Avalanche provides fast finality through a sampling-based consensus mechanism.

#### Key Features
- Sub-second finality
- High security
- Energy efficient
- Metastability-free

#### Implementation
```rust
pub struct AvalancheEngine {
    params: AvalancheParams,
    confidence: HashMap<TxId, Confidence>,
    network: Arc<P2PNetwork>,
}

pub struct AvalancheParams {
    sample_size: usize,
    threshold: f64,
    max_rounds: u32,
}
```

### 3. Dynamic Sharding

The sharding system automatically scales by creating and managing shards based on network load.

#### Key Features
- Automatic scaling
- Load balancing
- Cross-shard transactions
- State synchronization

#### Implementation
```rust
pub struct ShardManager {
    shards: HashMap<ShardId, ShardState>,
    load_balancer: LoadBalancer,
    cross_shard_coordinator: CrossShardCoordinator,
}
```

## Cross-Shard DAG System

### Overview

The Cross-Shard DAG system manages dependencies between transactions across different shards.

#### Visual Representation
```
Shard A           Shard B
  [DAG]            [DAG]
  T1 → T2         T4 → T5
   ↓               ↓
  T3(send) ----> T6(receive)
```

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Cross-Shard Transaction Flow
1. Transaction initiated in source shard
2. Dependencies verified across shards
3. Parallel processing where possible
4. Atomic commitment across shards

#### 2. Dependency Management
```rust
pub struct CrossShardTx {
    source_shard: ShardId,
    target_shard: ShardId,
    dependencies: Vec<TxId>,
    state_proof: StateProof,
}

pub struct StateProof {
    shard_state: ShardState,
    merkle_proof: MerkleProof,
    signatures: Vec<Signature>,
}
```

## Token System

### Smart Token Generator

The AI-assisted token creation system helps users design and deploy custom tokens.

#### Features
- Template-based creation
- AI-suggested parameters
- Automatic validation
- Custom modules

#### Implementation
```rust
pub struct TokenGenerator {
    templates: Vec<TokenTemplate>,
    ai_engine: AIEngine,
    validator: TokenValidator,
}

pub struct TokenTemplate {
    name: String,
    parameters: Vec<Parameter>,
    modules: Vec<Module>,
}
```

### Fee Optimization

The automated fee system optimizes transaction costs across shards.

#### Features
- Dynamic fee calculation
- Cross-shard fee routing
- Pool-based fee payment
- Automatic currency conversion

#### Implementation
```rust
pub struct FeeManager {
    fee_calculator: FeeCalculator,
    pool_manager: PoolManager,
    exchange_rate_oracle: ExchangeRateOracle,
}
```

## Governance System

### DAO-based Decision Making

The community governance system enables token holders to participate in platform decisions.

#### Features
- Proposal submission
- Voting mechanism
- Automatic execution
- Transparency

#### Implementation
```rust
pub struct GovernanceSystem {
    proposals: Vec<Proposal>,
    voting_power: HashMap<Address, VotingPower>,
    executor: ProposalExecutor,
}
```

## Security

### Transaction Audit System

Comprehensive transaction logging and verification system.

#### Features
- Real-time monitoring
- Audit trail
- Anomaly detection
- Compliance reporting

#### Implementation
```rust
pub struct AuditSystem {
    logger: TransactionLogger,
    monitor: SecurityMonitor,
    reporter: ComplianceReporter,
}
```

## Network Architecture

### P2P Network

The peer-to-peer network manages communication between nodes.

#### Features
- Node discovery
- Message routing
- State synchronization
- NAT traversal

#### Implementation
```rust
pub struct P2PNetwork {
    discovery: NodeDiscovery,
    router: MessageRouter,
    sync_manager: SyncManager,
}
```
